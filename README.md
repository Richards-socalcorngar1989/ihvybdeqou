Oh man, just left the theater and my head is still spinning – Warfare was like, BOOM, right from the get-go. My feet are sticky with soda from the floor, and there's popcorn in places I didn’t even know existed. Seriously, I’ve got a popcorn grizzly hiding under my jacket.

The opening sequence was like... was like... I don't even know, like a blender full of fireworks and real-world nightmare fuel all mashed together. I wish you were there to see it all unravel, Dan. Remember to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   when you can. 

>The whole damn cinema was vibrating. Probably messed up my spine a bit. My back’s never gonna forgive me, but worth it. Who even needs spinal integrity anyway when you’ve just seen that? Like, there was this scene with a tank. In space. Just floating. How's that even in the  ? But it made so much sense all at once and none at all. 

God, the way the characters just crossed over into weird existential crises mid-battle – like one second they’re shooting, next they're pondering life like a philosopher got lost on the battlefield. Or I might just be mixing that with a conversation I overheard from the couple sitting behind me. They smelt like nacho cheese.

There was just too much going on. My brain's putting two and two together to make five. Or twenty-two. 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the nutty parts and 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the bits in slow mo, it's all just too much. It's like they took an action   and decided to raise it on a steady diet of Red Bull and skittles, no joke.

Why was there that random panda? Did it symbolize peace or like... is my brain just fried? Felt like a dream sequence had a panic attack and ended up in the final cut. I keep thinking of that one snippet where the protagonist saved the day by painting a giant mural of his own face.

This is the kinda 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 you'd show aliens who ask what human art is like, and they'd probably just decide we're not worth it. Hands sweatvelty and kinda cold, clapping like it’d help gel the mosaic back together. I'm not sure if I've been enlightened or just confused on a transcendent level.
